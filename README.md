<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.

- python3

Check how to install here [python3_installation_instructions_link](https://www.python.org/)

- pip3

Check how to install here [pip3_installation_instructions_link](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/olmedoluis/pix.git
```

2. Give Permission to the installer file

```sh
sudo chmod +x ./install.sh
```

3. Run the installer

```sh

```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

- In order to see the status:

```sh
px work
```

- In order to add/stage files:

```sh
px add pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to add/stage and if there is more than one it will ask you which files you want to add/stage.

```sh
px add all pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to add/stage but it will not ask you to add/stage them.

- In order to remove/un-stage:

```sh
px remove pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to remove/un-stage and if there is more than one it will ask you which files you want to remove/un-stage.

```sh
px add all pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to remove/un-stage but it will not ask you to remove/un-stage them.

- In order to reset files as they were:

```sh
px reset pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to reset and if there is more than one it will ask you which files you want to reset.
This only resets the changes that are non-committed yet and the ones that are not added/staged.

```sh
px reset all pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available files to reset but it will not ask you to reset them.

- In order to interact with branches:

```sh
px branch pattern_path_to_the_file
```

It will search for the available branches and then.

```sh
px branch new
```

It will search for the available files to reset but it will not ask you to reset them.
